Hello, my name is Gert-Jaap, and I've been developing software for as long as I can remember. At the moment i'm completely focused on developing blockchain related projects.

My main focus is currently on the scalability of blockchains, and specifically their inability to. The solutions i'm working on are mostly centred around Layer 2 / Off Chain, meaning the use of the blockchain as a peg of trust by only transacting on chain if you really need to.

The best analogy would be to see the blockchain as a court. You only need to go to court in case someone acts maliciously. 

Layer 2 / Off chain solutions allow you to transact without using the blockchain, but peg the security to the chain by giving you the necessary information to enforce people to behave according to the blockchain's rules.

Want to learn more about my work, have me speak at one of your events about my work, or just want to chat? Feel free to reach out to me.
